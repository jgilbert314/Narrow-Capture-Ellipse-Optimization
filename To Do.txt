- Check if nu is a vector or constant
	- If vector, use loop
	- If constant, use eq. 2.14
	
- Update
	- meritFuncGeneral
		- to handle different traps
		-x (?) to handle different traps where epsilon is 0
		-  to reject case where epsilon is zero
		^ Check for contact between traps using (AMFPT < 0)
	- Initialization code
		- Allow vector for epsilon
		- Display user feedback indicating if traps are common size
	- coeffVecFunc
		^ Exploit symmetry of LHS
	- calcTwoTrapSizes
		- build epsilon vector using scaling factors
		
^ calcAMFPT
	^ check case nu constant
	^ check case nu vector
