General Notes:
	It seems that the coefficients used to calculate the AMFPT, defined in equation (4.1),
	depend on both the trap positions, and the size of the traps (epsilon). Looking at (4.1),
	it seems to me that the second term which be minimized to find the optimal trap arrangement,
	which seems to mean that the optimum depends on the size of the traps. This seems counter-intuitive
	based on my previous experience with the subject, but I'll check to see how it affects the optimum.
	! - should be able to figure this out by checking if direction of vector changes with epsilon
	
Code Notes:
	z_sumFunc
		- Sum of infinite series is approximated by adding all terms above machine precision
		keep in mind that this may be a prohibitively large calculation for some inputs (not fully tested)
	greensFunc, greensSingFunc
		- consider factoring common denominators from terms of sum. May speed up calculation.

	*** Write function to carry out optimization. See if optimal configurations seem reasonable as a way of 
	testing program so far.
